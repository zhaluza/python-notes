# Lambdas & Built-In Functions

## Lambdas

A **lambda function** is essentially an anonymous function.

It takes in arguments and returns something.

```python
square2 = lambda num: num * num

add = lambda a,b: a + b
```

A lambda is an inline function that eliminates the need for writing out entire functions, which can be helpful in certain situations.

For instance, instead of defining a function that will only be used once, you can just write a lambda.

## Map

A `map` is a standard function that accepts at least two arguments:

- A function
- An "iterable"

An **iterable** is something that can be iterated over (list, string, dictionary, set, tuple).

A map function runs the lambda for each value in the iterable and returns a map object â€” which can then be converted into another data structure.

If you don't wrap `map` in another data structure, it only works once.

```python
nums = [2,4,6,8,10]

doubles = map(lambda x: x*2, nums)

list(doubles)
# [4, 8, 12, 16, 20]

list(doubles)
# []
```

Instead, you could wrap it inside a list or another data structure.

```python
nums = [2,4,6,8,10]

doubles = list(map(lambda x: x*2, nums))

list(doubles)
# [4, 8, 12, 16, 20]
```

```python
names = [
{'first': 'Zac', 'last': 'Haluza'},
{'first': 'Dash', 'last': 'Rendar'}
]

first_names = list(map(lambda x: x['first'], names))

first_names
# ['Zac', 'Dash']
```

## Filter

`filter` lets us return a "filtered" version of a collection of data. It returns a filter object with the data that meets a specified condition.

```python
names = ['austin', 'penny', 'anthony', 'angel', 'billy']

# get the names starting with 'a'
a_names = filter(list(lambda name: name[0]=='a', names))

a_names
# ['austin', 'anthony', 'angel']
```

### Combining `filter` and `map`

Given this list of names:
`names = ['Lassie', 'Zac', 'Rusty']`

Return a new list with the string "Your instructor is " + each value in the array, but only if the value is less than 5 characters.

```python
list(map(lambda name: f"Your instructor is {name}",
filter(lambda value: len(value) < 5, names)))

# ['Your instructor is Zac']
```

You could accomplish this with a list comprehension:

```python
[f"Your instructor is {name}" for name in names if len(name) < 5]
```

However, it's important to be aware of the importance of filter and map.

Note that while using the filter and math methods might feel more natural for JavaScript developers, the "Python" way is to use a comprehension.
